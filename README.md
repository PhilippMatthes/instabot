# Instagram Python Bot

![Showcase](Logo.jpg?raw=true "DragTimer App")

This is my Instagram Bot. It is neither programmed nor structured very well. I just quickly wrote this down. So please keep this in mind. The main purpose of this bot is to programmatically follow, like, comment and unfollow on Instagram. If you have the time, help me refactoring this sloppy peace of software.

## Getting Started

You must use your own Telegram bot. It is used to control the instagram bot, in case there is something going wrong. Create your Telegram bot via the Telegram Botfather and note the Token. Make sure to start your bot so it is ready and running!

### Installing

Clone the git repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/PhilippMatthes/instabot.git
```

Install the needed packages.
```
python3 -m pip install selenium
python3 -m pip install urllib3
python3 -m pip install telepot
npm install chromedriver
```

To modify the topics which are scraped by the bot, change them in the Config.py File!

## Running the Bot

Make sure you are in the instabot directory.
```
cd instabot
```
Launch the bot and enter username and password as prompted.
```
sudo python3 Main.py
```
The terminal window will clear. You now have to switch over to your Telegram bot and send him "Start". The bot will launch.



### Controlling the bot via Telegram

```
Start - Starts the bot in the initial phase
Stop - Terminates the bot. It will not be able to run again!
Pause - Pauses the bot.
Continue - Continues after pausing the bot.
```
